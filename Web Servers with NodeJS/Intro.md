const server = http.createServer((req, res)=>{}))
both req and res are objects.

Using the req object we can look into the headers and the data which were passed using the http request.
And we can so write into the header and data of the res object accordingly


Both req and res are streams.
req is a readable stream while res is a writable stream.
